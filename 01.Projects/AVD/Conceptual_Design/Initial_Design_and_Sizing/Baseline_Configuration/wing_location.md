# Wing Location

## Things To Consider
- ground clearence (engine underneath the wings, prollers, loading/unloading)
- engine location ([[dihedral]])
- span loading is good and is achieved through putting the engines on the wing. Otherwise, the engines would be on the fuselage and the force of the lift to counter the weight of the engines will have to transfer from the wing to the fuselage.
- business jets might have engines on the fuselage as the engines can't fit on the wing

## Wing Vertical Location Low

Conventional tail is possible because at high angles of attack the separated flow doesn't impede on the tail. (no deep stall) [[deep_stall]]

## High Wing Location

Ground clearence might be an issue. The fuselage is low to the ground to allow for transport of good (loading and unloading). To enable to use of propellers which require a large diammeter.

reduces the ammount of ground affect when comming in to land and should be considered for short takeoff and landing.

## Mid Mounted Wing
aerobatic ability
highly manouverable aircraft

## Wing Structure
Normally, the structure of the wing carrys on through the fuselage.
