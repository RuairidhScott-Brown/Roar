# Wing Location

## Things To Consider
- ground clearence (engine underneath the wings, prollers, loading/unloading)
- engine location ([[dihedral]])

## Wing Vertical Location Low

Conventional tail is possible because at high angles of attack the separated flow doesn't impede on the tail. (no deep stall) [[deep_stall]]

## High Wing Location

Ground clearence might be an issue. The fuselage is low to the ground to allow for transport of good (loading and unloading). To enable to use of propellers which require a large diammeter.
