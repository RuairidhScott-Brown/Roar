# Engine Propulsion

- The exhaust of the engines could be used for lift to allow for short takeoff and landing
- cost of maintaining and engine is high and therefore accessing the engines is a priority

## Propeller
### Tractor
The prop sits infront of the engine.

- more common
- easier to cool

### Pusher
The prop sits behind the engine.

- more aero efficient
- worse cooling
- positioning the engine is sometimes a problem
