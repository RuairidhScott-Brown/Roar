# Engine Propulsion

- The exhaust of the engines could be used for lift to allow for short takeoff and landing
- cost of maintaining and engine is high and therefore accessing the engines is a priority
- integrated engines into the wing is dangerous as if one of the engines malfunctions dramatically then the wing could be damaged which is not good. If the engines are in pods then they can malfunction and not cause damage to the entire wing. The plane can then still glide.

## Propeller
### Tractor
The prop sits infront of the engine.

- more common
- easier to cool

### Pusher
The prop sits behind the engine.

- more aero efficient
- worse cooling
- positioning the engine is sometimes a problem

## Jet Engines
- Where the engine intakes can get the most of air.
