# Constraints Diagram

Assumed basic or initial value for lift to drag $\frac{L}{D_{max}}$, specific fuel consumption $c$, gross weight $W_o$, operating empty weight $W_e$, fuel weight $W_e$.

But we didnt make sure:

 - Ceilings (absolute, service, combat)
 - Maximum speed 
 - Time to climb / Rates of climb 
 - Sustained turn rates / radii 
 - Level (axial) acceleration 
 - Takeoff and Landing distances (TODA & LDA) 
 - Stall speed 
 - Make sure aircraft meets airworthiness requirements

## Key Parameters

- speed
- celing
