# General Sizing Constraints

Consider the design specification [[target_design_specification]].

Think about the weights and masses that dont change depending on the size of the aircraft.
-	crew
-	passengers
-	electronics

There are other weights and masses that change with the size of the aircraft.
- fuel
- structure

Think about the empty weight of the aircraft to the full weight and also the fuel weight.
