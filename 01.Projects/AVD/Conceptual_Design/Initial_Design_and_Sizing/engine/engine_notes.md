# Engine Notes

## Engine Matching

$$
\frac{T}{W} = 0.5 \rho V^2 \big( C_{D_0} + \frac{C_L^2}{e \pi AR} \big) \frac{S}{W}
$$

e is taken at its worst case
Cd is taken at its worst case
CL is taken from the wing choice
 S is from the wing
 AR from the wing
 maximum take of weight is taken
 thrust comes from the thrust required at cruise.
 
 The maufacturer will noramlly give the trust produced at sea level which will have to be altered for altiitude and installed losses.

A first correction of 0.92 is added to the thrust to account for the losses that take place when the engine is mounted to the fuselage. After this the, accouted equation for altitude is take.
