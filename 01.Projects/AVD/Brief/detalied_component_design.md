## Material
1/4 inch thick plate of 6082-T6 aluminium alloy


## Restrictions for Machining

- Minimum for all internal radii must be 4.00 mm
- Minimum for any internal cut-out radii must be 4.00 mm
- Minimum internal distance to any free edge 3.5 mm
- Minimum internal strut width 3.5 mm
- There is a 30.00 mm diameter safe area around the loading and supporting holes (shown in Figure 3). This area cannot be removed in your design.
- No taper in thickness is possible
- All removal of material must be through the entire thickness of the blank, i.e. no webs can be machined
