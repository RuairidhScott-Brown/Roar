# Preliminary Design Brief

## Initial Sizing of Primary Strucutres

- all weight distributions should be known
- bending moment, shear force and torque for each major structural member
	- load cases at max load factor on wing, fuselage, tail
	- symmetric flight
		-  maouver $V_a$
		-  dive $V_D$
		-  one engine inoperative conditions
			- load acting at $ac$ of vertical stabiliser such that the aircraft is directionally trimmed
			- asymmetrical loading condition 
		- front nose if off
			- aero loads can be ingored
- trapezodial or elliptic air loading distribution (N / m) across the span of the of the lifting surfaces
- wing box can be designed with the flexual axis axis at 
- the centre of the cross section of the wing box for all aero structures
- single stringer type, with the pitch remaining constant throughout, may be assumed for each aerodynamic structural component of the empennage
-  The fuselage weight should be modelled as a simple load per unit length
-  cargo, weights, etc. this can be added as a further distributed weight along the fuselage
-  ignore the presence of windows and floor and focus only on the primary loading paths
-  one of the empennage structures must be of composite construction
-  only the wing strucutre should have a fatigure life of 30, 000 cycles
