# Front Matter

This is meta data for our content file. Hugo automatically add in data to content files when they are created and this is called front matter. The data is normally in key value pairs.

example: yaml
```yaml
---
title: "Dir2"
date: 2021-09-25T18:11:39+01:00
draft: true
---
```

example: toml
```toml
+++
title = "Dir2"
date = 2021-09-25T18:11:39+01:00
draft = true
+++
```

The data in the front matter can be seen in the cards for the content files. This is theme dependant
