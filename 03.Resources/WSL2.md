# How to Install WSL2 on Windows

I followed this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fntjriRe48

1. Check that you are running a windows version that supports this: ==19041 and above==
2. Go to `windows features on or off` window and activate: Virtual Machine Platfrom, Windows Subsystem for Linux

```ad-note
color: 200, 200, 200

You might have trouble with windows hyper-V also being activated too so just be aware that your system might not reboot. To get over this issue  you will have to reboot your computer in [[windows_safe_mode]] and get rid of the features you've activated.
